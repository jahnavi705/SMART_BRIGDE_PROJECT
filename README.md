# Smart Rotten Fruits & Vegetables Sorting System
## Project Overview

The **Smart Rotten Fruits & Vegetables Sorting System** is an intelligent system designed to automatically detect and separate rotten fruits and vegetables from fresh ones using image processing and machine learning techniques.

This project helps reduce food waste, improve quality control, and automate sorting processes in markets, warehouses, and agricultural industries.

## Problem Statement

- Manual sorting of fruits and vegetables:

- Takes more time

- Requires continuous human effort

- May lead to inaccurate sorting

To solve this problem, we developed a smart automated system that can detect rotten produce efficiently and accurately.

## Solution

Our system uses:

- Image processing techniques

- Machine Learning / Deep Learning model

- Camera module for capturing images

- Automated decision logic for classification

The model classifies items into:

1. Fresh

2. Rotten

Based on the prediction, the system can trigger a sorting mechanism.

## Technologies Used

- Python

- OpenCV

- TensorFlow 

- NumPy

- CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)

## How It Works

- Capture image of fruit/vegetable

- Preprocess the image (resize, normalize, etc.)

- Pass image to trained ML model

- Model predicts whether item is Fresh or Rotten

- Sorting mechanism separates the item

## Features

- Real-time detection

- High accuracy classification

- Reduces manual effort

- Helps in minimizing food wastage

- Cost-effective solution

## Future Improvements

- Increase dataset size for better accuracy

- Deploy as a web/mobile application

- Integrate IoT for smart warehouse monitoring

- Add multi-category detection

## Applications

- Supermarkets

- Food processing industries

- Agricultural warehouses

- Quality control systems
